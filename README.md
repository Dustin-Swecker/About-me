# About-me
<br>
  <p>Hi, my name is Dustin Swecker.</p>
  <p>I'm 41 and I'm transitioning into a new career after serving 20 years in the Army and subsequently as a contractor for the Army. My aspiration is to eventually become a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
  <p>I'm a dad with two bright and beautiful children newly in their teens. My son is 14 and recently eclipsed 6' in height. He enjoys playing League of Legends, Battlerite, and Valorant. My daughter just turned 13. She loves Roblox and Minecraft, and recently started using makeup (oy vey!)!</p>
  <p>I'm excited to learn to code because the future of everything seems driven by coding and the ability to code. I want to be a part of this future.</p>
  <p>Hopefully, this new chapter kicks off an adventure full of opportunity and exploration. I'm looking forward to applying the skills I'm learning and reaching out and meeting     all the wonderful people in the world of coding.</p>
