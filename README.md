Hi, my name is Dustin Swecker.
I'm 41 and I'm transitioning into a new career after serving 20 years in the Army and subsequently as a contractor for the Army.
I'm excited to learn to code because the future of everything seems driven by coding and the ability to code. Also, the lifestyle of coding fits me. I'm laid back and focused on the results of my labor.
Hopefully, this new chapter kicks off an adventure full of opportunity. I'm looking forward to applying the skills I'm learning and reaching out and meeting all the wonderful people in the world of programming and coding.
